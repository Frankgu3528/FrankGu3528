# Diving into the world of AI is fun， isn't it?

I’m currently majoring in statistics in Zhejiang University. 

I have a wild interest in many fields, not only includes causal inference/Deep Learning theory.
I used to  worked in [Center for Data Science](http://cds.zju.edu.cn/) to apply some Deep model to tabular and time series data.
Now I am apply some LLM to EEG data to create some thrilling BCI project.

Becides research, I'm also a fan of:
- photography
- bike riding
- politics
